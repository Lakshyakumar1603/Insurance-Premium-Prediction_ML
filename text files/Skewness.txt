Skewness in EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of a dataset’s distribution. In EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), skewness helps to understand whether a dataset is normally distributed or distorted due to extreme values (outliers).

Types of Skewness
Positive Skewness (Right-Skewed)

The right tail is longer.
The mean is greater than the median.
Example: Income distribution (a few people have very high salaries).
Skewness > 0


Negative Skewness (Left-Skewed)

The left tail is longer.
The mean is less than the median.
Example: Age at retirement (most people retire at 60-65, few earlier).
Skewness < 0


Zero Skewness (Symmetric Distribution)

Data is normally distributed (bell-shaped curve).
Mean ≈ Median ≈ Mode.
Example: Heights of people.
Skewness ≈ 0


Why Is Skewness Important in EDA?
Helps decide whether to transform data (e.g., log transformation for highly skewed data).
Influences choice of statistical tests (e.g., parametric vs. non-parametric tests).
Affects the performance of machine learning models, especially those sensitive to normality (like linear regression).
