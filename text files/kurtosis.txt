Kurtosis in EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the tailedness of a distribution compared to a normal distribution. It helps in understanding whether a dataset has extreme values (outliers) and how they are distributed.

Types of Kurtosis
Mesokurtic (Normal Kurtosis)

The distribution is similar to a normal distribution.
Kurtosis â‰ˆ 3 (in some statistical libraries, excess kurtosis = 0).
Example: Heights of people.
Indicates a balanced distribution.


Leptokurtic (High Kurtosis)

The distribution has heavy tails (more extreme values/outliers).
Kurtosis > 3 (excess kurtosis > 0).
Example: Stock market returns (few extreme gains/losses).
Indicates data has more extreme outliers.


Platykurtic (Low Kurtosis)

The distribution has light tails (fewer extreme values).
Kurtosis < 3 (excess kurtosis < 0).
Example: Uniform distribution.
Indicates a lack of extreme values.


Why Is Kurtosis Important in EDA?
Helps detect outliers (high kurtosis = more outliers).
Influences the selection of statistical tests (e.g., parametric vs. non-parametric).
Affects machine learning models, especially those sensitive to extreme values (like linear regression).
How to Calculate Kurtosis in Python?
You can use Scipy or Pandas
